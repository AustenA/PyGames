Some python games I made. Some old, some new, all pretty trash.

CarAndTrack.py loads track.png. You basically can load any black and white image and will detect if the car intersects with the black track.

Snake.py is the classic snake game. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to get the array to move the snake correctly.

TicTacToe.py is a 2 Player TicTacToe game that actually says who won so that was repetitive to code. But ended up working nicely.

Pong is just a series of classic pong games that are all slightly different. I never got the angles to change so they are basically always the same.
